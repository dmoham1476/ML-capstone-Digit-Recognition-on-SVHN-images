Digit Recognition from SVHN images using Convolutional Networks

1_SVHN.ipynb: download SVHN dataset and preprocess MNIST like cropped single-digit SVHN data.
2_ConvNet.ipynb: build a baseline convolutional neural network for cropped single-digit SVHN images.
3_ConvNetFinal.ipynb: build a deep convolutional neural network and implement the final solution

This project requires Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

TensorFlow
SciPy
Matplotlib
Numpy
Python 2.7

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook

The 1_SVHN.ipynb when run will download the SVHN dataset from the repository and we are going to use the .mat file format only for this project.

These are the jupyter python notebook files that need to be executed. From the top-level project directory capstone/, run the following commands to open the jupyter notebook and then run each cell

python 1_SVHN.ipynb
jupyter notebook 1_SVHN.ipynb 
python 2_ConvNet.ipynb
jupyter notebook 2_ConvNet.ipynb
python 3_ConvNetFinal.ipynb
jupyter notebook 3_ConvNetFinal.ipynb
